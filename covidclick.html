        <p>Rahul Dravid, India's head coach, has tested positive for Covid-19 and is not travelling with the rest of the team that will assemble in Dubai today for the Asia Cup. It is believed Dravid had mild symptoms, which have receded. He will test again in two days' time. Paras Mhambrey, the bowling coach, will step in till then.

            A call on whether VVS Laxman - who coached India in Zimbabwe as Dravid took a short break - will join the team in Dubai too will likely be taken only after Dravid takes the test in two days. India's first match in the Asia Cup will be on August 28 against Pakistan.</p>

        <p>"Team India Head Coach Rahul Dravid has tested positive for COVID-19 in a routine test conducted ahead of the team's departure to the UAE for Asia Cup 2022," a BCCI release said. "Mr. Dravid is under the supervision of the BCCI Medical team and has mild symptoms. He will join the team once he returns with a negative COVID-19 report. The rest of the team will assemble in UAE on 23rd August, 2022."</p>

            <p>The Asia Cup is likely to be India's last tournament before they announce the team for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October-November. In that light, the Asia Cup is an important tournament for the decision-makers to be around. It is believed that 11 or 12 slots in the squad are more or less booked, but the Asia Cup could have a bearing on the last three-four places. India will also be waiting on the fitness of Harshal Patel and Jasprit Bumrah who are at NCA in Bangalore for rehab.</p>

                <p>"I want to thank everyone at the Pakistan Cricket Board, women's wing and the entire side who not only backed and supported me but also made my stay memorable and comfortable. I will remain a big fan of Pakistan women's cricket, will continue to follow their progress with excitement and remain confident that better results and successes await them down the road."

                    More recently, ahead of the Commonwealth Games, Pakistan blanked Sri Lanka 3-0 in the T20I series at home before taking the ODI series 2-1. Their next assignment is the ODI series at home against Ireland in November, which will be part of the ICC Women's Championship.
                    
                    Tania Mallick, PCB head of women's wing, paid tribute to Hemp by saying, "It is sad to lose someone of David's caliber, enthusiasm and strong work ethics, but at the same we also understand and accept that family has to come first. The PCB thanks David for all his efforts and contributions, and wishes him best of luck in his future endeavours."</p>
